# eyeMovement
Program of a set of eyes that follows the cursor using js, html, and css. The initial color of the sample code was blue and I changed it to purple. 

Roadmap For Future Improvements:
I am going to add more eyeballs all over the page and they will all follow the cursor as well as change color depending on where the cursor is on the page.
